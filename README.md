# Kindle-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiment in Kindle product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It employs traditional text representation methods including Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Average Word2Vec embeddings to convert textual data into numerical features. These representations are then used to train machine learning models for classifying review sentiments as positive or negative. The project aims to compare the effectiveness of these NLP techniques in capturing sentiment-related features from real-world user reviews.
